CYCLIC BINARY STRING


Given a binary string s of length n, you can cyclically shift this string any number of times. For example, consecutively applying cyclic shift operation to the binary string 
"1011010" you will get "0101101", "1010110" and so on.
Let X be the decimal representation of string s. Find the greatest power of 2 with which X can be divisible with, if it can be divisible with arbitrarily large power print "-1".
For the result, you are required to print a single integer denoting the maximum power of 2 by which X can be divisible with.

For example if string s = "1001", we can cyclically shift 1 time to get string "1100" which in decimal is 12 and is divisible with 2^2, hence the answer is 2.

Input Format

The first and only line of input contains string s.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the maximum power of 2 by which X can be divisible with.

Sample Input 0
0011

Sample Output 0
2

Explanation 0
We can cyclically shift the string 2 times to get "1100" which is divisible by 2^2 hence the answer is 2.

Sample Input 1
111

Sample Output 1
0

Explanation 1

The string will remain same even after any number of cyclic shifts, and the given string in decimal is 7, which is divisible by 2^0 hence the answer is 0.
